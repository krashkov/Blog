    "Finite volume method is a universal tool for constructing *conservative* schemes which are based even on unstructured meshes. Consider the following equation in divergence form:\n",

    "The main idea of FVM is to approximate this conservation law. Suppose that the computational domain $\\Omega$ is divided into elements $V_i$ so that $\\Omega = \\cup_i V_i$. For each cell let us introduce the average value $u_i = \\frac{1}{V_i} \\int_{V_i} udV$. Note that $u_i$ is associated with center of $i$-th cell. Conservation law for each cell can be written as: \n",

As a result, finite volume scheme takes the following form:\n",
